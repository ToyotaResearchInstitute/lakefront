 * AdditionalJSONFilter Component
 * 
 * The AdditionalJSONFilter component is a "pseudo" filter used in Filter JSON input to track additional,
 * user-supplied JSON values which have no equivalent UI filter to represent them.
 * It acts like any other filter, in that is is able to parse its own value from a query string,
 * serialize to a query string, and show a filter chip label in the Filter Bar,
 * but it has (by default) `inputHidden` set to true which causes it to not render any UI in the filter drawer.
 * 
 * This filter (by default) intentionally does not implement getFilterValueFromApiPostBody, because the useFilter hook
 * sets this filter's value based on the JSON "leftover" after all the other filters parse their values from JSON.
